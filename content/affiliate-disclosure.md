# Affiliate Disclosure

**Last Updated: August 30, 2025**

## Transparency Promise

At AI Smart Home Hub, we believe in complete transparency with our readers. This disclosure explains how we may earn revenue through affiliate marketing partnerships while maintaining our editorial independence and providing honest, unbiased reviews.

## What Are Affiliate Links?

Affiliate links are special tracking links that allow us to earn a small commission when you purchase products through our recommendations. **This does not affect the price you pay** - you pay the same price as if you had visited the retailer directly.

### How They Work
1. **You click** on a product link in our review or recommendation
2. **You're redirected** to the retailer's website (like Amazon)
3. **You make a purchase** at the regular price
4. **We earn** a small commission (typically 1-8% of the sale)
5. **You pay nothing extra** - the commission comes from the retailer's marketing budget

## Our Affiliate Partnerships
