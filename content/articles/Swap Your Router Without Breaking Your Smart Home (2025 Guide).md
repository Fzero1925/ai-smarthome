> **Quick answer** — When replacing your router/mesh, **clone your old SSID and password** so most devices auto-reconnect. Expect a few stragglers (they cache BSSID/security details); be ready to **Forget & Rejoin** on those. If you’re moving to WPA3 or a new mesh, verify band names and avoid per-band SSIDs per **Apple’s recommendations**. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

## Applies to
- Any home migrating from one router/mesh to another  
- Mixed IoT fleets (bulbs, plugs, thermostats, cams)

## Migration plan (30 minutes)
1. **Audit** your current Wi-Fi: SSID, password, security (WPA2/WPA3), DHCP range, reservations.  
2. **Configure new router** with the **same SSID/password** first—this keeps the majority of devices online automatically, per mainstream best practice. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
3. **Align band naming**: Apple recommends **one SSID for all bands** (2.4/5/6 GHz) for reliability; avoid per-band names unless debugging. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
4. **Reconnect outliers**: Some clients notice **BSSID/security** differences even with the same SSID; for these, **Forget network → Rejoin** (Windows doc shows why). :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
5. **Only then** consider security upgrades (WPA3-SAE) and advanced features.

## Troubleshooting matrix
| Symptom                                           | Likely cause                  | What to do                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A few devices won’t reconnect                     | BSSID/security cache mismatch | On each device: **Forget** old network → **Rejoin**; power-cycle if needed. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17} |
| Apple gear shows “limited compatibility” on 6 GHz | Bands have different names    | Use one SSID across bands as Apple recommends. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18} |
| IoT gadgets won’t onboard after upgrade           | WPA3 transition quirks        | Temporarily set **WPA2-PSK**, onboard, then evaluate WPA3 after. (See eero WPA3 notes.) :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19} |

## Brand / Advanced notes
- If you’re running two routers during the swap, **don’t** keep both with the same SSID/password simultaneously—some vendors warn about conflicts; finish the cutover cleanly. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}  
- Moving to a new mesh (e.g., eero/Nest): after the cutover, **update DHCP reservations** so hubs/bridges keep the same IPs for local integrations.

## Common pitfalls
- Renaming bands (e.g., “Home-2G” / “Home-5G”) permanently—this often **reduces reliability** for roaming/6 GHz devices. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}  
- Upgrading security to **WPA3** *during* the migration—do it after everything is stable. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}

## FAQ
- **Will everything reconnect if I clone SSID/password?**  
  In most cases, yes. But devices that remember **BSSIDs** (AP MACs) or auth mode may need a manual reconnect. :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}
- **Should I split bands for IoT?**  
  Prefer **one SSID** first. Use a separate **guest/IoT** SSID only if onboarding is unreliable.
