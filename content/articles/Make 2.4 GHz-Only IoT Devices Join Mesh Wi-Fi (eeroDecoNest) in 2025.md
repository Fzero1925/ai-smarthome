> **Quick answer** — On **eero**, temporarily enable **Legacy/Compatibility Mode** to help legacy 2.4 GHz clients see the SSID, then turn it back **off** after onboarding. On **TP-Link Deco**, create an **IoT Network** set to **2.4 GHz only**. On **Nest Wifi/Pro**, follow Google’s guidance to ensure your **phone is on 2.4 GHz** during setup or use a temporary 2.4 GHz AP/guest network. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Applies to
- Mesh systems: **eero**, **TP-Link Deco**, **Nest Wifi/Pro**  
- 2.4 GHz-only devices (plugs, bulbs, sensors, older cams)

## 5-minute fixes by brand
1) **eero**  
- eero uses a **single SSID** across bands. If legacy devices can’t detect the network, enable **Legacy/Compatibility Mode** in the eero app (Settings → Troubleshooting → *My device can’t detect Wi-Fi 6* → toggle **Legacy Mode**). **Turn it off** after the device joins to restore performance/security features. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

2) **TP-Link Deco**  
- In the Deco app or web UI, create **IoT Network** and set it to **2.4 GHz only** with its own SSID/password; some models require recent firmware. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

3) **Nest Wifi / Nest Wifi Pro**  
- Google notes some smart-home devices only support **2.4 GHz**. During onboarding, ensure your **phone** is on 2.4 GHz (some phones let you force this), or use a temporary **2.4 GHz hotspot/guest SSID** to complete setup. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Troubleshooting matrix
| Symptom                             | Likely cause                                  | What to do                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Device “can’t find network” on eero | WPA3/802.11ax features confuse legacy devices | Temporarily enable **Legacy/Compatibility Mode**; onboard; then disable. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} |
| Joins but drops soon after          | Band steering or RSSI too low                 | Bring phone + device within ~2 m; complete pairing; relocate device only after it is stable. |
| Deco “IoT Network” option missing   | Model/firmware limitation                     | Update firmware or use Guest SSID set to 2.4 GHz only. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} |
| Nest Wifi cannot split bands        | Design choice                                 | Follow Google’s 2.4 GHz setup tips or use a temporary 2.4 GHz AP/hotspot with same SSID/pass to onboard. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} |

## Brand / Advanced notes
- **eero Compatibility Mode** also disables some optimizations (e.g., WPA3, steering, some DFS use). Use as a **temporary** onboarding tool. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- If your device is extremely old, **WPA3 transition** can still be problematic—use **WPA2-PSK** during pairing if needed, then revert. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- As a general workaround across brands, a **guest SSID** locked to **2.4 GHz** is often the cleanest long-term solution. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

## Common pitfalls
- Leaving eero in Legacy/Compatibility Mode permanently (reduced performance/security). :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- Pairing far from the router/AP; complete onboarding **within a few meters** first.  
- Hidden SSIDs and exotic passwords (some IoT stacks choke on special characters).

## FAQ
- **Can I force Nest Wifi to broadcast a separate 2.4 GHz SSID?**  
  No—follow Google’s guidance to ensure the phone is on 2.4 GHz or use a temporary AP/guest network. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
- **Is WPA3 causing failures?**  
  Sometimes. eero documents interoperability issues with legacy clients in WPA3 transition mode. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
