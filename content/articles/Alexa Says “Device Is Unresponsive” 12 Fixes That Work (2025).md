> **Quick answer** — Power-cycle the Echo **and** your router, confirm the device is online in the maker’s app, then **disable & re-enable** the Alexa Skill and run discovery again. If the error persists, remove the device from Alexa, re-link the Skill, and update firmware before a last-resort factory reset.

## Applies to
- Echo speakers/displays and third-party Alexa devices  
- Cloud-linked devices (via Skills) and local Zigbee devices on Echo hubs

## 5-minute fixes (start here)
1. **Reboot order**: unplug Echo → reboot router → plug Echo back in and wait for the blue ring to settle.  
2. **Verify device is online** in its **manufacturer app**; if it’s offline there, fix Wi-Fi first.  
3. **Disable & re-enable the Skill** for that brand, then **Discover Devices**.  
4. **Check names & groups**: avoid duplicates (“Lamp” in two systems).  
5. **Update firmware** (Echo + device) and retry.

## Troubleshooting matrix
| Symptom                              | Likely cause                 | What to do                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| “Device is unresponsive” in app      | Skill session or token stale | **Disable/enable Skill**, sign back in, then **Discover Devices**. |
| Voice works but app shows error      | App cache/state mismatch     | Force-quit Alexa app; clear cache; sign out/in.              |
| Device drops after hours             | Wi-Fi band/roaming issues    | Place device within ~10 m; try the other band (2.4/5 GHz); reserve DHCP. |
| Zigbee devices fail only on Echo Hub | Hub radio glitch             | Reboot Echo; if needed, remove & re-add Zigbee device.       |
| Nothing helps                        | Corrupt state                | **Remove device from Alexa** and re-link; last resort **factory reset** per model. |

## Brand / Advanced notes
- **Skills are the control plane** for many brands; stale authorizations often cause “unresponsive.” Re-linking refreshes tokens.  
- **Network hygiene** matters: simplify SSIDs, avoid special characters, and ensure the device’s cloud can reach your LAN through your router’s DNS/firewall defaults.  
- If you recently **changed SSID/password**, re-provision in the manufacturer app first, then rediscover in Alexa.

## Common pitfalls
- Renaming a device in the brand app but not syncing to Alexa.  
- Using identical names in multiple Skills (“Kitchen Light” in two ecosystems).  
- Skipping the device firmware update after onboarding.

## FAQ
- **Do I need to reset my Echo?**  
  Usually **no**—try Skill re-linking and device reboot first. If Echo shows persistent faults, perform a factory reset as a last resort.  
- **Local Zigbee vs. cloud Skills—which is more reliable?**  
  Local Zigbee on Echo hubs removes one cloud hop, but you still need solid RF and up-to-date firmware.
