> **Quick answer** — Put smart plugs/bulbs/cams on a **separate SSID**. On **TP-Link Deco**, use **IoT Network (2.4 GHz-only)**. On **ASUS**, create a **Guest** SSID and **disable “Access Intranet.”** On **UniFi**, enable **Network Isolation** on a dedicated VLAN and bind it to a Wi-Fi. On **Google Nest Wifi**, create a **Guest Wi-Fi** and optionally share only specific devices (Chromecast/TV) to guests.

## Before you start
- Keep the main SSID for phones/laptops/hubs; use the IoT SSID for low-power devices.  
- Use simple SSID/password; stick to **WPA2/WPA3**; avoid special characters some IoT stacks choke on.

## How-to by brand (10 minutes each)

### TP-Link Deco / Archer
1. Log into the web UI/app.  
2. **Advanced → Wireless → IoT Network** → create a **2.4 GHz** SSID/password for IoT.  
3. Connect devices to this SSID; keep your main SSID for everything else.

### ASUS (ASUSWRT)
1. Go to **Guest Network** → create a Guest SSID.  
2. Under **Network → General → Access Intranet**, **disable** it to block guest devices from your internal LAN.  
3. Apply and connect IoT devices to this Guest SSID.

### UniFi (Ubiquiti)
1. **Settings → Networks** → create/select a dedicated **VLAN** for IoT and **Enable Network Isolation**.  
2. **Settings → WiFi** → create an IoT Wi-Fi and **assign** it to that network.  
3. (Optional) Add explicit firewall rules for allow-lists (e.g., allow traffic only to a bridge/hub IP).

### Google Nest Wifi / Pro
1. Google Home app → **Create a Guest Wi-Fi**.  
2. Optionally **share specific devices** (e.g., Chromecast) with guest users while keeping your intranet private.

## Troubleshooting matrix
| Symptom                                | Likely cause                     | What to do                                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| IoT device can’t discover a TV/speaker | Isolation is working (by design) | Temporarily share that device on Nest Wifi, or add an allow-rule on UniFi; on ASUS, leave “Access Intranet” **enabled** for that single guest SSID if needed. |
| Camera streams fail on smart display   | Cloud vs local path mismatch     | Ensure the cloud link works in the vendor app first; allow local casting only if required. |
| Older devices won’t connect            | 2.4 GHz only                     | Ensure the IoT SSID is **2.4 GHz** (Deco’s IoT mode), and keep width at **20 MHz**. |

## Common pitfalls
- Expecting guest/IoT networks to access NAS/printers by default (they’re intentionally **isolated**).  
- Forgetting to keep **hubs/bridges** reachable if your automations depend on local control—use allow-lists instead of turning isolation off globally.

## FAQ
- **Will a guest/IoT network break casting?**  
  It can. On **Nest Wifi**, you can share specific devices to guests. On **UniFi/ASUS**, add targeted allow-rules or enable intranet access only for that one SSID.  
- **Should I put everything IoT on 2.4 GHz?**  
  Most low-power IoT prefers 2.4 GHz—start there unless your device vendor supports 5 GHz/Matter-over-Thread differently.
