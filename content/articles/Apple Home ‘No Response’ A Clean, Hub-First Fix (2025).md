> **Quick answer** — Confirm you have a **home hub** (HomePod mini/HomePod/Apple TV 4K) online, then reboot the **modem/router → bridges/hubs → accessories → iPhone** in that order. Turn on **Bluetooth**, check the **manufacturer app** for firmware, and only then consider resets.

## Applies to
- Apple **Home** on iOS/iPadOS 18 or newer  
- Accessories that support Home or **Matter** via bridges/hubs

## 5-minute hub & network checks
1. **Verify a home hub is connected** (Home settings → Home Hubs & Bridges).  
2. **Reboot in sequence**: modem/router → third-party bridges → home hubs → accessories → phone.  
3. **Enable Bluetooth** on iPhone/iPad; some accessories need it for control.  
4. **Update accessory firmware** in the maker’s app; retry in Home.

## Troubleshooting matrix
| Symptom                        | Likely cause                        | What to do                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| “Home hub required” appears    | No active hub / wrong device as hub | Set up **HomePod mini/HomePod/Apple TV 4K** as home hub.     |
| Devices all show “No Response” | Stuck network state                 | Perform the **reboot order**; verify the hub shows **Connected**. |
| Remote notifications missing   | Hub offline or unsupported          | On the latest Apple Home, **iPad is not a supported hub**; use HomePod/Apple TV. |
| Some devices only fail         | Firmware/app mismatch               | Update in maker app; if still failing, **remove and re-add** the accessory. |

## Brand / Advanced notes
- **Thread-based Matter accessories** require a **Thread-enabled** hub (HomePod mini or Apple TV 4K Wi-Fi + Ethernet, 3rd gen).  
- For reliability, keep your **hub on Ethernet** if possible; avoid moving hubs into cabinets.

## Common pitfalls
- Thinking any iPad can be a hub on the latest Apple Home（已不支持）.  
- Resetting accessories before you try the **hub-first reboot** and firmware checks.

## FAQ
- **Do I need a hub to add accessories?**  
  Apple’s current guidance emphasizes setting up a **home hub** for adding **Matter** accessories and for automations/notifications to work reliably.  
- **Which hub should I pick?**  
  **HomePod mini** or **Apple TV 4K (latest)** are Thread-enabled and work as robust hubs.
