> **Quick answer** — Use **standard, non-rechargeable alkaline** AA cells (what most vendors recommend), fix **door/deadbolt alignment** so the motor isn’t fighting friction, keep **firmware updated**, and trim extras (beeps/LEDs/over-aggressive auto-lock). In cold or hot environments, expect **shorter life** and service the door hardware first.

## What’s normal?
- Typical modern locks last **months** on a fresh set of alkalines under average use.
- Sudden drops after days/weeks usually point to **mechanical friction**, **bad cells**, or **Wi-Fi/Z-radio** settings that keep radios awake.

## Do these first (15 minutes)
1. **Fresh alkalines** (full set): replace all cells together; avoid mixing brands/ages.  
2. **Door alignment**: with the door open, lock/unlock; if it’s smooth in the air but grinds when closed, adjust the **strike plate** until the bolt glides.  
3. **Update firmware** for the lock/bridge in the official app.  
4. **Trim power features**: temporarily disable beeps/LED status; review auto-lock timing (e.g., 2–5 min vs 30s) and reduce retries.

## Brand notes that matter
- **August**: Use **standard non-rechargeable alkaline** cells; fix **deadbolt friction** (strike alignment) to stop excessive draw.  
- **Yale**: Recommends **alkaline**; battery drain **accelerates in temperature extremes**—service door hardware and replace with quality alkalines.  
- **Schlage**: Uses **alkaline**; lithium or rechargeable chemistries can behave poorly with lock voltage thresholds—stick to alkalines unless the model explicitly says otherwise.  
- **Kwikset**: Advises **non-rechargeable alkalines**; also suggests turning off **lock sounds/LED** to extend life.

## Troubleshooting matrix
| Symptom                  | Likely cause                   | What to do                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Dies in 1–2 weeks        | Door not aligned; motor stalls | Re-center strike; ensure bolt throws without rubbing; re-calibrate if the app supports it. |
| Drops fast in winter     | Chemistry/temperature effects  | Use quality **alkalines**; reduce auto-lock triggers; fix friction points; check weatherstripping. |
| Battery % jumps around   | Mixed/old cells or bad batch   | Replace with new **matching** alkalines from the same pack.  |
| Works open, fails closed | Frame bind                     | Shim or re-seat strike plate; confirm latch alignment before re-testing. |
| Random reboots/offline   | Firmware or bridge issues      | Update lock + bridge; power-cycle bridge; reduce Wi-Fi distance (or use the official bridge model). |

## Common pitfalls
- Mixing cell types/ages; using rechargeables where the vendor **doesn’t** support them.  
- Ignoring **mechanical friction**—99% of “bad battery” cases are really door/strike issues.  
- Over-tightened escutcheon screws warping the chassis.

## FAQ
- **Can I use lithium AAs?**  
  Only if your vendor explicitly allows. Many locks are tuned for **alkaline** voltage curves.  
- **Do I need a C-wire-style power kit?**  
  No—locks are battery devices. Focus on alignment, firmware, and radios.
