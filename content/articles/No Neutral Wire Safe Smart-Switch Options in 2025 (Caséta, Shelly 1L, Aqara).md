> **Quick answer** — If your wall box lacks a **neutral**, use a **Lutron Caséta** in-wall **dimmer** that is **designed for no-neutral installs**, or consider a **relay that supports no-neutral** (e.g., **Shelly 1L**) which can require a **bypass** on low loads. Some brands (e.g., **Aqara No-Neutral** models) also target this scenario—but always follow the **official wiring specs** and consult a **licensed electrician** when in doubt.

## Understand your options
- **Lutron Caséta dimmers (e.g., PD-6WCL)**: explicitly rated **no neutral required**. Ideal when you control **dimmable** loads.  
- **Relays w/o neutral (Shelly 1L/2L)**: may need a **bypass** with low-wattage LED loads.  
- **Aqara “No Neutral” wall switches**: region/model specific; require an **Aqara Hub** and follow the listed wiring diagrams.  
- If none fits your circuit or load, keep power **always on** and use **smart bulbs + wireless remotes** (e.g., Hue Dimmer/Aurora) to avoid cutting mains power to smart lamps.

## 10-minute checklist
1. **Confirm the box really has no neutral** (usually not present in switch-loop circuits).  
2. If using **Caséta**: choose a **no-neutral dimmer** (not all models are dimmers) and verify the **compatible load types/wattage**.  
3. If using **Shelly 1L**: check **minimum load**; add a **bypass** if your LED load is too low; follow the exact terminal map.  
4. If using **Aqara no-neutral**: verify **model/region**, required **hub**, and max load.  
5. After install, **test flicker**, **low-end trim** (for dimmers), and **overheat**/status LEDs; keep a **non-smart fallback** if needed.

## Troubleshooting matrix
| Symptom                          | Likely cause                           | What to do                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| LED flicker at low levels        | Minimum load not met                   | Add the vendor **bypass** (Shelly) or raise minimum dim level (Caséta). |
| Switch reboots or won’t latch on | Miswire / wrong model for load         | Recheck line/load; confirm **no-neutral** variant; verify max wattage. |
| Bulbs glow when “off”            | Leakage current in no-neutral topology | Install **bypass** per vendor; use compatible dimmable loads. |
| Overheat/shutdown                | Over-wattage or enclosed box heat      | Reduce load; use correct dimmer type; consult electrician.   |

## Common pitfalls
- Assuming **all** Caséta/other brands are no-neutral—many models **do** require neutral.  
- Skipping the **bypass** on tiny LED loads with no-neutral relays.  
- Mixing non-dimmable loads with a **dimmer** model.

## FAQ
- **Can I use a no-neutral relay with smart bulbs?**  
  It’s better to keep bulbs powered and control via **wireless remotes/scenes**, not by cutting mains to smart bulbs.  
- **Is there a universal “no-neutral” fix?**  
  No—follow **brand-specific** guidance (Caséta dimmer, Shelly 1L + bypass, Aqara no-neutral).
