> **Quick answer** — Verify **Ethernet** to your **primary router**, then check the Bridge LEDs: **power**, **network**, **internet**, and the **Zigbee ring**. If Wi-Fi congestion is high, change the **Hue Zigbee channel** in the Hue app (choices **11/15/20/25**) to avoid overlap with Wi-Fi channels **1/6/11**. Power-cycle router + Bridge; only factory-reset as a last resort. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

## 10-minute checklist
1. **Bridge → Router via Ethernet** (avoid daisy-chained hubs/switches while testing). Confirm **Network (middle) LED solid**; if blinking/off, reseat cable/port and reboot router + Bridge. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
2. **Understand LEDs**: left = power; middle = network; right = Hue cloud; ring = Zigbee radio. If the right light won’t come on, **update Bridge firmware** in the app. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
3. **Zigbee vs Wi-Fi overlap**: Wi-Fi 1/6/11 overlaps Zigbee 11–22; try Zigbee **15 or 20** (or **25** if supported) to reduce collisions. Change channel in **Hue app → Bridge settings → Zigbee channel**. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
4. **DHCP/IP sanity**: ensure your router’s **DHCP** is on so the Bridge gets an IP; optionally reserve a static lease after recovery. (General networking guidance.) :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
5. **Bulbs show ‘Unreachable’**: make sure physical **power is on** to fixtures; toggling power often restores a lost bulb. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}

## Troubleshooting matrix
| Symptom                 | Likely cause           | What to do                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| App can’t find Bridge   | Ethernet or DHCP issue | Test another router port/cable; reboot router/Bridge; verify network LED solid. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18} |
| Many lights unreachable | 2.4 GHz interference   | Change **Hue Zigbee channel**; keep Wi-Fi on 1/6/11; retest. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19} |
| Works, then slows/drops | Channel congestion     | Move to **15/20/25**; avoid co-channel with your Wi-Fi. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20} |
| Nothing helps           | Corrupt state          | **Factory-reset** Bridge (pinhole) only as last resort; you’ll re-pair in app. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21} |

## FAQ
- **Does changing Zigbee channel break my setup?**  
  The app performs a network retune; lights should rejoin automatically. If a few don’t, power-cycle those fixtures and retry. (General practice; supported channels 11/15/20/25.) :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}  
- **Why Ethernet instead of Wi-Fi?**  
  Hue Bridge is **wired by design** and forms a **Zigbee mesh** to bulbs; a stable wired uplink reduces latency and packet loss. :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}
