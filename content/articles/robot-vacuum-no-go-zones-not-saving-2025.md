> **TL;DR** — Save a stable map from the dock → draw **No-Go/Virtual Wall** → **Save** → **run once from the dock** to commit changes. Roborock requires **Map Saving** and **Save**; Ecovacs applies virtual boundaries **on the next departure**; Eufy supports No-Go/Virtual/No-Mop zones (limits vary by model).

## Applies to
- Roborock (S-/Q- series with map saving)
- Ecovacs DEEBOT (ECOVACS App)
- Eufy RoboVac (models with maps & zones)

## Quick steps
1. **Create/refresh a map** from the dock (full/quick clean).  
2. **Edit map → No-Go/Virtual Wall → Save.**  
3. **Run once from the dock** so newly added boundaries take effect.  
4. After app/firmware updates, **re-save** zones; clear cache and reboot robot/router if needed.

## Troubleshooting matrix
| Symptom                       | Likely cause                         | What to do                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Zones don’t apply immediately | Brand applies on next run            | Start a short clean **from the dock** to commit.             |
| Can’t draw/save zones         | Map saving disabled / forgot to Save | Enable **Map Saving** (Roborock) and **Save** after editing. |
| Robot crosses a boundary      | Zone too thin or misaligned          | Draw a larger rectangle or longer virtual wall; **Save** again. |
| Zones vanish after updates    | App/firmware/cache reset             | Re-save boundaries and do one run from the dock to confirm.  |
| Multi-map confusion           | Model/series limits                  | Verify multi-map support; keep one primary map if unstable.  |

## Brand notes
- **Roborock** — Turn on **Map Saving**, then **Edit Map → No-Go/Virtual Wall → Save**; many models allow up to ~10 no-go zones per map.  
- **Ecovacs** — Virtual boundary **takes effect the next time the robot leaves the charging dock**; while returning to dock, boundaries are ignored.  
- **Eufy** — Supports **No-Go / Virtual Wall / No-Mop** on many models; always **Save** after editing; some models limit the count per type.

## Common pitfalls (don’t…)
- Move the dock and expect the old map to align—relocate >2 m often requires a remap.  
- Use “hairline” walls for complex paths—draw wider zones for reliable avoidance.  
- Skip a verification run after updates or big edits.

## FAQ
- **Why do my zones disappear after an update?**  
  App/firmware updates may invalidate cached maps. Re-save boundaries and run once from the dock to apply.
- **Do I need physical magnetic strips?**  
  Only older models; most current models honor virtual boundaries once saved and committed.
- **Can I move the dock?**  
  Keep it fixed. If you must move it, remap and re-add boundaries to avoid offsets.
