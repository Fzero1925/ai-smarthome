> **Quick answer** — Save a stable map from the dock → draw **No-Go / Virtual Wall** → **Save** → **start one run from the dock** to commit changes. Roborock needs **Map Saving** enabled and a **Save** tap; Ecovacs applies virtual boundaries **on the next departure**; Eufy supports **No-Go / Virtual / No-Mop** zones (limits vary by model).

## Applies to
- Roborock S/Q series (with map saving)
- Ecovacs DEEBOT (ECOVACS App)
- Eufy RoboVac models that support maps and zones

## 5-minute fix (works for most cases)
1. Dock the robot and ensure you have a **clean map** (quick/full clean to refresh if needed).
2. Open the app → **Edit Map** → add **No-Go Zone / Virtual Wall**.
3. Tap **Save** (brand UIs differ; confirm the save indicator).
4. **Start a short clean from the dock** so newly added boundaries take effect.
5. After app/firmware updates, **re-save** zones; clear app cache, then reboot robot/router if needed.

## Troubleshooting matrix
| Symptom | Likely cause | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| Zones don’t apply immediately | Brand commits on next run | Start a short clean **from the dock** to commit. |
| Cannot draw/save zones | Map saving disabled / forgot to Save | Enable **Map Saving** (Roborock) and **Save** after editing. |
| Robot crosses the line | Zone too thin or misaligned | Draw a larger rectangle or longer virtual wall; **Save** again. |
| Zones vanish after updates | App/firmware/cache reset | Re-save boundaries and do one verification run from the dock. |
| Multi-map confusion | Model/series limits | Verify multi-map support; keep one primary map if unstable. |

## Brand specifics (evidence-based)
- **Roborock** — Turn on **Map Saving**, then **Edit Map → No-Go/Virtual Wall → Save**; many models allow **up to 10 no-go zones** per map.  
  *Reference: Roborock support tutorial.*
- **Ecovacs** — Virtual Boundary **takes effect the next time the robot leaves the charging dock**; boundaries are ignored while it is **returning to dock**.  
  *Reference: ECOVACS help center.*
- **Eufy** — Supports **No-Go / Virtual Boundary / No-Mop** on many models; **Save** after editing; some models limit each type to **up to 10** per map.  
  *Reference: eufy support articles.*

## Common pitfalls (avoid these)
- Moving the dock and expecting the map to align—relocations over ~2 m often require a remap.
- Using “hairline” walls for complex paths—draw wider zones for reliable avoidance.
- Skipping a verification run after big edits, firmware updates, or app reinstalls.

## FAQ
**Why do my zones disappear after an update?**  
App/firmware updates may invalidate cached maps. Re-save boundaries and run once from the dock to apply.

**Do I need magnetic strips?**  
Only on older models. Most current models honor virtual boundaries once saved and committed.

**Can I move the dock?**  
Keep it fixed. If you must move it, remap and re-add boundaries to avoid offsets.
