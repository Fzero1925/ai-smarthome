> **Quick answer** — In the Ring app, ensure **Live View is enabled** for the camera, then check **RSSI** in Device Health. If RSSI is worse than the recommended range, move the router/AP closer, use **2.4 GHz**, or add a booster (e.g., Chime Pro/mesh). If the device is offline or stuck, **reboot** the camera and router; as a last resort, **factory reset** and **re-setup**.

## Applies to
- Ring **doorbells** and **cameras** across battery and wired models.

## 10 fixes (fast to slow)
1. **Turn on Live View**: Ring app → Device → **Device Settings** → **Video Settings** → **Live View**.  
2. **Check RSSI**: Ring app → **Device Health** → **Signal Strength**; aim for **0 to −60 (great)**, −60 to −70 is **okay**.  
3. **Prefer 2.4 GHz** for range; many devices connect more reliably at 2.4 GHz than 5 GHz.  
4. **Reboot** the Ring device from the app; power-cycle your router.  
5. **Improve Wi-Fi**: move router/AP, add **Chime Pro** or a mesh node near the camera.  
6. **Battery & power**: charge battery models fully; verify wired models meet power specs.  
7. **Reduce congestion**: limit simultaneous streams or calls during troubleshooting.  
8. **Update firmware** in the Ring app.  
9. **Factory reset** the device (hold setup button per model) and perform a fresh setup.  
10. **Re-test RSSI** after changes and relocate hardware if needed.

## Troubleshooting matrix
| Symptom                            | Likely cause                    | What to do                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| “Activating Live View” spinner     | Weak RSSI / congestion          | Improve RSSI toward **0 to −60**; prefer 2.4 GHz; add Chime Pro/mesh node. |
| Works on recordings, not Live View | App toggle off / transient link | Enable **Live View**; reboot device; recheck Wi-Fi and RSSI. |
| Device offline                     | Network or power issue          | Follow **offline device** guide; reboot/reset; verify power for wired units. |

## Common pitfalls
- Treating **RSSI** as a positive value—Ring shows it as **negative dBm** (closer to 0 is better).  
- Leaving the device on 5 GHz at the edge of range.  
- Skipping the in-app **Live View** toggle when diagnosing streams.

## FAQ
- **What RSSI is “good enough”?**  
  Ring’s guidance places **0 to −60** as **Great** and **−60 to −70** as **Okay**; improve coverage if you’re worse than that.  
- **Do I need special ports or DNS?**  
  Usually no—focus on **signal quality** and **bandwidth** first per Ring’s own troubleshooting.
