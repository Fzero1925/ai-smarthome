> **Quick answer** — **Do not put smart bulbs on a hardware wall dimmer.** Smart bulbs need **constant, full line power** and handle dimming in-app or via accessories. LIFX states explicitly: its bulbs are **not compatible** with hardware dimmers. For Hue and others, keep the circuit **always on** and use wireless controls (Hue Dimmer, **Lutron Aurora** that locks the toggle ON), or replace the dimmer with an **on/off smart switch**. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

## Applies to
- Philips Hue, LIFX, GE Cync, TP-Link, Nanoleaf and other **smart bulbs**
- Homes where a **legacy dimmer** was left in-circuit

## 5-minute fix (no rewiring)
1. **Bypass or leave the wall dimmer ON** permanently.  
2. Add a **wireless** control: Hue Dimmer Switch or **Lutron Aurora** to keep power constant while giving a real button. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
3. Control brightness in the bulb’s app, your platform (Home/Google/Alexa), or via the wireless control.

## Troubleshooting matrix
| Symptom                        | Likely cause                              | What to do                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Flicker at low levels**      | Triac dimmer + LED driver mismatch        | Remove/bypass hardware dimmer; if keeping a (non-smart) LED on a dimmer, tune **low-end trim** per Lutron guidance. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15} |
| **Buzz/hum**                   | Dimmer operating outside compatible range | Same as above; use a dimmer/LED combo with a verified compatibility list. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16} |
| **Bulb resets, drops offline** | Intermittent power from wall dimmer       | Provide **constant power** and control brightness in software; use Aurora/Hue Dimmer. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17} |

## Brand / Advanced notes
- **LIFX**: “Not compatible with hardware dimmer switches.” This is the cleanest, official statement you’ll find — treat it as representative for **smart bulbs in general**. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}  
- **Hue**: Keep bulbs powered; add **Hue Dimmer** or **Lutron Aurora** to get tactile control without cutting power. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}  
- **Why dimmers cause trouble**: Triac/ELV dimmers **modulate voltage**; many smart-bulb drivers expect **full sine** at the socket. The result can be strobing or unstable power. ENERGY STAR’s flicker guidance explains why some LED+dimmer pairs misbehave. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}

## Common pitfalls
- Mixing **smart bulbs** with a **load-controlling smart dimmer** on the same circuit — one fights the other.  
- Assuming “dimmable LED” labeling applies to **smart bulbs**. It usually applies to **non-smart** LEDs on **compatible dimmers**.  
- Forgetting that killing line power at the wall makes smart bulbs **unreachable** for automations.

## FAQ
- **Can I dim a smart bulb from the wall at all?**  
  Yes — use a **wireless** smart control designed for smart bulbs (Hue Dimmer, Aurora) or a scene-capable keypad that talks to the hub, not the load. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}
- **What if I want a real, wired dimmer?**  
  Use **non-smart, dimmable LEDs** with a **listed compatible dimmer**, or move to **smart switches** controlling dumb bulbs. Lutron’s docs show how to remove flicker by adjusting trim. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}
