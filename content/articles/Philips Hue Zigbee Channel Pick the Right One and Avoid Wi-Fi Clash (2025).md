> **Quick answer** — Keep **Wi-Fi on 1/6/11 (20 MHz)** and place Hue’s Zigbee on **15/20/25** to reduce overlap. You can change the **Zigbee channel** in the **Hue app → Settings → Bridge settings → Zigbee channel**. After the change, give your mesh a few minutes to settle and avoid frequent channel flips.

## Why channels matter
Zigbee operates in the **same 2.4 GHz band** as Wi-Fi—overlaps cause retries, lag, and drops. Planning Wi-Fi on **1/6/11** creates “gaps” where Zigbee channels **15/20/25** tend to suffer less interference. Channel **26** often has lower TX power and isn’t broadly supported; Hue exposes **11/15/20/25**.

## 10-minute plan that works
1. **Check your Wi-Fi** — Lock 2.4 GHz to **1, 6, or 11** at **20 MHz** width.  
2. **Pick a Zigbee target** — Start with **20** or **25** if your Wi-Fi sits on 1 or 6; pick **15** if your Wi-Fi sits on 11.  
3. **Change it in Hue** — Hue app → **Settings** → **Bridge settings** → **Zigbee channel** → **Change**.  
4. **Wait and verify** — Allow a few minutes for bulbs/sensors to roam. Don’t bounce channels repeatedly.  
5. **Fine-tune** — If a few devices misbehave, power-cycle those bulbs, or move repeaters (wired bulbs) to improve the mesh.

## Troubleshooting matrix
| Symptom                              | Likely cause                          | What to do                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Lights lag or drop at certain times  | Wi-Fi crowding on your Zigbee channel | Move Wi-Fi to **1/6/11** (20 MHz) and set Zigbee to **15/20/25**; avoid channel 11 + Wi-Fi 1 together. |
| A few battery sensors stop reporting | Slow roam to the new channel          | Wait 10–15 min; briefly pull/reinsert batteries on stubborn devices. |
| Things improved, then regressed      | Auto Wi-Fi width or DFS changes       | Force Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz width to **20 MHz**; keep SSID constant. |

## Common pitfalls
- **Changing Zigbee too often** — let the mesh converge.  
- **40 MHz on 2.4 GHz** — massively increases overlap; stick to **20 MHz**.  
- **Assuming all Zigbee devices like channel 26** — many don’t; Hue doesn’t expose it.

## FAQ
- **Will I need to re-add bulbs after a channel change?**  
  Normally **no**—devices rejoin automatically within minutes.  
- **What channels does Hue Bridge support?**  
  **11, 15, 20, 25**. Choose based on your Wi-Fi layout.
