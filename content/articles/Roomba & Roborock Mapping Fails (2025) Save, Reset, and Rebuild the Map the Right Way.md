> **Quick answer** — For **Roomba**: if a map is corrupt or wrong, **delete the Smart Map** and run **Mapping Runs** to rebuild. For **Roborock**: make sure **Map Saving** is **ON**, then **Reset Map** and do a full run from the dock. Use bright lighting, clear floors, and don’t interrupt runs.

## Applies to
- Roomba with **Imprint™ Smart Maps** (i3/i4/i5/j7/s9 and similar).  
- Roborock S-series (S5/S6/S7/S8 and variants) using the Roborock or Mi Home app.

## Clean rebuild (Roomba)
1. In the iRobot Home app, **delete the existing Smart Map**.  
2. Start **Mapping Runs** (exploration without vacuuming) until the map completes; customize rooms afterward.  
3. If you factory reset, enable the **“Save maps during factory reset”** toggle first so maps are backed up (on supported models).

## Clean rebuild (Roborock)
1. In the app, open **Vacuum Settings → Map Saving** and ensure it is **ON**.  
2. Use **Reset Map** to clear a broken map.  
3. Start a full clean/mapping from the **dock** with floors picked up; avoid pausing and keep doors open.

## Troubleshooting matrix
| Symptom                            | Likely cause                  | What to do                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Roomba “map won’t save”            | Damaged/partial map           | **Delete map**, run **Mapping Run** to rebuild, then re-label rooms. |
| i3/i4/i5 can’t store multiple maps | Model limit                   | i3/i4/i5 support a **single** Smart Map—delete to remap another floor. |
| Roborock can’t edit rooms          | Map Saving off                | Turn **Map Saving ON**; rebuild, then split/merge rooms and save. |
| Map drifts / rooms shifted         | Dock moved or run interrupted | Keep dock fixed; complete at least one **uninterrupted** mapping cycle. |

## Common pitfalls
- Interrupting mapping runs or moving the dock mid-run.  
- Trying to maintain multiple maps on models that **support only one**.  
- Poor lighting and clutter causing SLAM to fail.

## FAQ
- **Do I need to vacuum to build maps?**  
  On Roomba, **Mapping Runs** exist specifically to map **without** vacuuming.  
- **Will resets erase maps?**  
  Yes—unless you enable **map-backup** (where supported) before a factory reset.
