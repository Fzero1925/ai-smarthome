> **Quick answer** — A smart thermostat needs a **reliable 24 VAC common (C)** for stable power. If your system lacks one, use the **Nest Power Connector** for Nest, or the **ecobee Power Extender Kit (PEK)** for ecobee, instead of random third-party adapters. Nest explicitly warns that some non-Nest adapters can cause issues or damage. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Applies to
- **Nest**: Thermostat, Thermostat E, Learning Thermostat  
- **ecobee**: Smart Thermostat models that include or support **PEK**  
- Low-voltage **24 VAC** HVAC systems (forced-air, heat pump, many boilers). Not for **line-voltage** (120/240 V) baseboard heaters.

## 5-minute decision tree
1. **Check wires** behind your old stat: If you see **C** (often blue), you’re set — land it on **C** at the new thermostat.  
2. **No C available?**  
   - **Nest** → Prefer **Nest Power Connector** at the air handler/furnace control board. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
   - **ecobee** → Use **PEK** if you have at least **R, G, Y, W** present. It “creates” a C using existing conductors. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
3. **Edge cases**  
   - **Battery/brownout messages, random reboots** → This is classic “not enough power,” add **C** or the brand’s adapter. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
   - **Two-wire heat-only boilers** → You’ll likely need a **brand-approved adapter** or a **new cable** pulled from the furnace.  
4. **Millivolt or line-voltage?** Stop. These are **incompatible** with standard 24 VAC smart stats without special hardware.

## Troubleshooting matrix
| Symptom                                   | Likely cause                      | What to do                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| “Help me wire a C” prompt during setup    | Controller detects marginal power | Add **C wire** or the **brand’s** power adapter (Nest Power Connector / ecobee PEK). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} |
| Thermostat reboots, battery drains        | Power stealing unstable           | Install the proper adapter; avoid third-party “C-wire kits” not approved by the thermostat maker. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} |
| Fan runs when AC is on but no C available | Shared **G/Y** hack miswired      | Use the **official** adapter (PEK/Nest PC) rather than combining wires incorrectly. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} |

## Brand / Advanced notes
- **Nest**: The **Nest Power Connector** is designed for Nest thermostats and **recommended over** generic C-wire adapters due to compatibility and damage risk. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- **ecobee**: The **PEK** lets you retrofit when **C** is missing by remapping furnace board terminals; use ecobee’s wiring diagram during install. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- **Testing**: After wiring, run the thermostat’s **equipment test** (fan/heat/cool) to confirm each relay energizes correctly.

## Common pitfalls
- Reusing a questionable **third-party adapter** — may introduce noise, brownouts, or damage. Prefer the **official** adapter. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- Confusing **line-voltage** (120/240 V) systems with **low-voltage 24 VAC** — smart stats target **24 VAC**.  
- “Power-stealing” only installs on multi-stage/heat pump systems — these are the first to show instability without a **C**.

## FAQ
- **Do I always need a C wire?**  
  Not always — but if the stat shows power/battery errors or fails during calls for heat/cool, add **C** or the maker’s adapter. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
- **Can I repurpose the fan (G) as C?**  
  Sometimes, but it often breaks fan control. The brand adapters (Nest PC / ecobee PEK) are safer. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
- **Will a universal external transformer work?**  
  It can, but it’s rarely tidy and can violate local code/practices. Prefer **brand-approved** solutions. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
