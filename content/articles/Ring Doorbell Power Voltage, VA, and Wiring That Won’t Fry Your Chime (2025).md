> **Quick answer** — **Match Ring’s official voltage/VA** for your model, or use a Ring-approved adapter. Typical ranges: **8–24 VAC** for battery doorbells and **10–24/16–24 VAC** (model-specific) for wired/Pro models, with **8–40 VA** or **10–40 VA** minimums depending on the doorbell. Never guess—**check your exact model** before wiring.

## Model power table (summary)
| Model family                                              | Transformer spec (VAC / VA) | Notes                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Battery doorbells**                                     | **8–24 VAC**, 5–40 VA       | Optional hardwire to trickle-charge.                         |
| **Video Doorbell Wired**                                  | **10–24 VAC**, **8–40 VA**  | Requires hardwire; no battery.                               |
| **Video Doorbell Pro / Wired Video Doorbell Pro (Pro 2)** | **16–24 VAC**, **10–40 VA** | Use the included **Pro Power Kit**/bypass wiring as directed. |

## 5-minute safety & wiring checks
1. **Identify the transformer** (label near panel/chime).  
2. Compare to the **table/spec**; if under-spec, replace transformer or use **Ring Plug-In Adapter**/**DIN Rail** as listed by Ring.  
3. If upgrading transformer, **turn off power** at breaker; follow Ring’s wiring diagram.  
4. After wiring, test **mechanical chime** (if present) and doorbell video; watch for brownouts/reboots.

## Troubleshooting matrix
| Symptom                        | Likely cause                | What to do                                                |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Video drops or reboots on ring | Transformer VA too low      | Upgrade to the Ring-spec VA or use official adapters.     |
| Chime hums or won’t ring       | Wiring/diode/kit wrong      | Recheck model-specific wiring (Pro Power Kit or bypass).  |
| Overheat warnings              | Wrong transformer/DC supply | Use only **Ring-approved** AC ranges or Ring DC adapters. |

## Common pitfalls
- Assuming **any** 16 VAC transformer is fine—**VA matters** as much as voltage.  
- Mixing third-party “doorbell power supplies” that don’t meet Ring specs.  
- Ignoring the **Pro Power Kit** instructions on Pro models.

## FAQ
- **Can I power a Ring with a DC adapter?**  
  Use only Ring-approved adapters (e.g., **Plug-In Adapter**/**DIN Rail**) listed for your model.  
- **Do I still need my old chime?**  
  Not necessarily—Ring can work without it; follow the model’s wiring guide for **bypass** options.
