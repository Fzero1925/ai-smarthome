> **Quick answer** — Change **default passwords**, enable **MFA** where available, keep **firmware auto-updates** on, segment devices with a **guest/IoT network**, and disable **UPnP/WPS/remote admin** unless you truly need them. These are echoed by **CISA**, **UK NCSC**, and the **FTC**. :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}

## The baseline (do these first)
1. **Unique passwords** for router + Wi-Fi + device accounts; never reuse. (FTC) :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}  
2. **Enable MFA/2FA** on cloud accounts for cams/locks/routers. (FTC) :contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}  
3. **Automatic firmware updates** for router & devices; apply patches promptly. (CISA/NCSC) :contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}  
4. Put IoT on a **guest/IoT SSID** (or VLAN if your gear supports it). (CISA/NCSC) :contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}  
5. **Turn off** UPnP, WPS, and remote admin unless required; if enabled, monitor and lock down. (FTC/CISA) :contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}

## Hardening the network
- **Rename SSIDs smartly** (no personal info), use strong WPA2/WPA3. (NCSC/Apple) :contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}  
- Keep an **inventory** of devices; remove unknowns. (CISA) :contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}  
- Prefer **vendor apps with security disclosures**; the UK’s new regime bans weak default passwords across many consumer IoT devices—good news for buyers. :contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}

## Troubleshooting matrix
| Symptom                          | Likely cause              | What to do                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Camera account takeover attempts | Credential stuffing       | Change to a **unique password**; enable **MFA**; check for reuse via password managers. (FTC) :contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33} |
| Random port opens on router      | UPnP exposure             | Disable **UPnP**; manually forward only what you need; review logs monthly. (FTC/CISA) :contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34} |
| Devices vanish from app          | Old firmware / DHCP churn | Enable auto-updates; consider **DHCP reservations** for hubs/bridges. (CISA) :contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35} |

## Common pitfalls
- Leaving default admin passwords or not changing Wi-Fi keys after sharing. (FTC) :contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36}  
- Mixing untrusted devices with your work laptop on the **same** SSID—segment them. (CISA/NCSC) :contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}  
- Ignoring app permissions and data-sharing toggles.

## FAQ
- **Should I buy only WPA3 gear in 2025?**  
  Prefer WPA3-capable routers, but many IoT clients remain **WPA2-only**. Use strong WPA2 where WPA3 breaks onboarding, then revisit later. (CISA acknowledges device diversity.) :contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}
- **Is a guest network enough?**  
  For most homes, yes. If you run a prosumer setup, use **VLANs** to isolate IoT from personal/work devices. (NCSC) :contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}
