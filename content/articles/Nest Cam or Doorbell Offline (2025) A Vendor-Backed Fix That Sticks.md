> **Quick answer** — Check **home Wi-Fi** first, confirm your **upload bandwidth** meets camera requirements, reduce **interference** (distance/obstructions), then **restart** the camera/doorbell. If issues persist, **lower video quality** to conserve bandwidth or, as a last resort, **factory reset** and set up again.

## 10-minute recovery plan
1. **Verify Wi-Fi works** for other devices on the same network (turn off cellular on your phone while testing).  
2. **Check upload bandwidth** near the camera; if low, reduce competing traffic or lower camera quality.  
3. **Reduce interference**: move the camera/router closer by a foot or two; remove obstructing appliances/walls where possible.  
4. **Restart** the camera/doorbell; wait a few minutes for it to reconnect and show live video.  
5. **Still offline?** Consider **factory reset** using the device’s reset button and repeat setup.

## Troubleshooting matrix
| Symptom                              | Likely cause          | What to do                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Offline during video calls/streaming | Upstream saturated    | Pause high-bandwidth apps; reduce camera quality; upgrade ISP tier if needed. |
| Goes offline when moved              | Range or interference | Bring closer, avoid large appliances/metal; consider extending coverage. |
| Never reconnects after restart       | Corrupt state         | Perform **factory reset** and set up again following the official steps. |

## Common pitfalls
- Testing bandwidth at the router instead of where the **camera** is installed.  
- Ignoring interference sources (microwaves, fridges, dense walls).  
- Repeated resets without first validating bandwidth and interference.

## FAQ
- **Does lowering video quality really help?**  
  Yes—Google’s guide explicitly recommends lowering quality when bandwidth is limited.  
- **Do older Nest devices behave differently?**  
  Management across apps is improving, but you should still follow the official **Wi-Fi troubleshooting** and **reset** procedures for your specific model.
