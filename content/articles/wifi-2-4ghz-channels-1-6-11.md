> **Quick answer** — On **2.4 GHz**, choose **channel 1, 6, or 11** and force **20 MHz** channel width. This minimizes adjacent‑channel overlap and improves reliability for IoT onboarding.

## Why only channels 1 / 6 / 11
- In 2.4 GHz, **1/6/11 are the only non‑overlapping channels**. Using others creates adjacent‑channel interference and hurts reliability.  
- Auto‑channel often picks poorly in dense apartments; manually pin **1/6/11** and verify later with a spectrum scan if available.

## Why 20 MHz (not 40 MHz) on 2.4 GHz
- Enterprise guidance and vendor docs strongly favor **20 MHz** on 2.4 GHz for compatibility and stability in limited spectrum. Many APs default to 20 MHz on 2.4 GHz.

## 5‑minute setup (most routers)
1. Router admin → 2.4 GHz → set channel to **1, 6, or 11** (pick the quietest).
2. Lock **channel width = 20 MHz**.
3. If onboarding fails, create a **temporary 2.4 GHz‑only SSID**; remove it after pairing.

## Smart‑home tips
- Many IoT devices are **2.4‑only**. If pairing fails, ensure the phone doing onboarding is also on 2.4 GHz (disable band steering temporarily).
- Keep hubs/routers out of metal cabinets and away from large appliances.
- For space‑heater control via smart plugs: **plug heaters directly into a wall outlet, never an extension cord or power strip** (fire safety best practice).

## FAQ
**Should I ever use 40 MHz on 2.4 GHz?**  
Only in very clean RF environments with few neighbors. Otherwise stick to **20 MHz**.

**What about 5/6 GHz?**  
Use them for higher‑bandwidth clients. Keep 2.4 GHz for reach and IoT reliability.

**DFS channels?**  
Useful in 5 GHz for capacity if supported and stable; **not relevant** to 2.4 GHz.
