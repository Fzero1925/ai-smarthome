> **TL;DR** — On **2.4 GHz**, pick **channel 1, 6, or 11** and force **20 MHz** channel width. This minimizes adjacent-channel overlap and improves reliability for IoT devices.

## Why only 1 / 6 / 11
- In 2.4 GHz, **1/6/11 are the only non-overlapping channels**; using others creates adjacent-channel interference and hurts reliability.  
- Auto-channel often picks poorly in dense apartments; manual selection of **1/6/11** is safer.

## Why 20 MHz (not 40 MHz) on 2.4 GHz
- Vendor and enterprise documentation consistently recommend **20 MHz** on 2.4 GHz for reliability/compatibility in limited spectrum.  

## 5-minute setup
1. Router admin → 2.4 GHz → manually set **1, 6, or 11** (try the quietest).  
2. Lock **channel width = 20 MHz**.  
3. For an IoT-only SSID, keep “40 MHz” and band-steering features off during onboarding; re-enable later if stable.

## Smart-home tips
- Many IoT devices are **2.4-only**; if onboarding fails, create a **temporary 2.4G SSID** and remove it after pairing.  
- Keep hubs/routers out of metal cabinets and away from large appliances.  
- For space-heater safety (unrelated to Wi-Fi but common in smart plugs): **plug heaters directly into a wall outlet, never an extension cord or power strip.**

## FAQ
- **Should I ever use 40 MHz on 2.4 GHz?**  
  Only in very clean RF environments; otherwise, stick to **20 MHz**.  
- **What about 5/6 GHz?**  
  Reserve these for higher-bandwidth clients; keep 2.4 GHz for IoT and reach.  
- **DFS channels?**  
  Useful in 5 GHz for capacity if supported and stable; not relevant to 2.4 GHz.
